# Security Assessment Report

## Summary
This document provides a security assessment of the Podcast Manager application as of January 2025.

## Security Audit Results

### Dependencies
- ✅ **No vulnerabilities found** in npm audit scan
- ✅ All dependencies are up-to-date versions
- ✅ Security-focused middleware implemented (helmet, cors)

### Server Security Measures

#### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```javascript
helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
      connectSrc: ["'self'"],
    },
  },
})
```

#### CORS Configuration
- Production: Same-origin only (CORS disabled)
- Development: Restricted to localhost:5173 and 127.0.0.1:5173
- Credentials enabled for authenticated requests

#### Request Size Limits
- JSON payload limit: 50MB (appropriate for CSV uploads)
- URL encoded payload limit: 50MB

#### Compression
- Gzip compression enabled for performance
- No security risks identified

### Environment Security

#### Environment Variables
- ✅ Example configuration provided (`.env.example`)
- ✅ Production secrets excluded from version control
- ⚠️ **Action Required**: Change default SESSION_SECRET in production

#### File System Access
- Limited to configured download directory
- No arbitrary file system access from web interface
- File paths are validated and sanitized

### Data Security

#### Database
- SQLite database with prepared statements (prevents SQL injection)
- No sensitive user data stored
- Local file storage only

#### Input Validation
- CSV parsing with validation
- URL validation for download endpoints
- File path sanitization

## Security Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Change Production Secrets**: Update SESSION_SECRET in production environment
2. **File Path Validation**: Ensure all file operations validate paths against traversal attacks
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for API endpoints

### Medium Priority
1. **HTTPS**: Ensure HTTPS is used in production deployment
2. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing stack traces in production errors
3. **Logging**: Implement security event logging

### Low Priority
1. **Headers**: Consider additional security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
2. **Session Management**: Implement proper session handling if user authentication is added

## Compliance Notes

### Privacy
- No personal data collection
- Local storage only
- No external data transmission except for podcast downloads

### Data Handling
- All data remains on local machine
- No cloud storage or external APIs (except for downloading podcasts)
- User has full control over data

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- ✅ Local-only application
- ✅ No user authentication required
- ✅ No sensitive data handling
- ✅ Limited attack surface

### Potential Risks
- File system access (mitigated by path validation)
- Network requests for downloads (standard HTTP/HTTPS)
- Large file uploads (mitigated by size limits)

## Security Monitoring

### Recommendations
1. Regular dependency updates
2. Periodic security audits
3. Monitor for new vulnerabilities in used packages
4. Review file system permissions
